0: Define a function that can replace its relative link from a complete URL
# 1~3 read a relative link, storage vocabulary, and give its definition, then save it
    1: Open a relative link from a complete URL then return how many vocabularies in the relative link
        1a: Give a word and return its relative link
        1b: Use Beautifulsoup,  parser and decode defined URL
        1c: Get vocabularies from this relative link
        1d : 1d: Feedback to the user how many vocabularies was found in these relative links
    2: check if want to store a definition or not, storage a vocabulary (from relative links) and its definition (user-defined)
        2a: Request to key-in a word and store its definition when the user feedback 'Y'
            2a.1: Give a warning when vocabulary's definitions are not empty
            2a.2: Request a definition
            2a.3: Store it in a defined dictionary
    3: After completing to storage vocabulary and its definitions, save file and print vocabulary and its definition to a file
        3a: check  the longest characters in the storage dictionary
        3b: Request a filename from the user
        3c: follow the order to store the term(vocabularies/definitions to the file)
